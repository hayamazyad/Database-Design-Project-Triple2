# Triple 2 Theatre – Database Design Project

This repository presents the complete design and implementation of a relational database system for **Triple 2 Movie Theatre (222)**—a fictional cinema franchise with complex operational needs. The system models real-world business processes such as ticketing, scheduling, customer loyalty programs, and staff management. 

## Overview

Triple 2 (222) is an international movie theatre chain that offers a high-end cinematic experience. To support its operations across multiple branches, the database system handles:

- Ticketing and seat reservations
- Movie screenings and scheduling
- Employee and department management
- Customer memberships and loyalty discounts
- Supplier and equipment inventory tracking
- Feedback, reviews, and branch-level analytics

The database has been carefully designed and normalized to ensure efficiency, data integrity, and support for complex queries.

## Features

- ER model with 20 distinct entity types and 17 relationship types
- Composite, multivalued, and derived attributes
- Use of weak entities and various cardinality relationships (1:1, 1:N, M:N)
- Subtyping (e.g., Standard vs. Premium members)
- Multilingual support for movies, genres, and subtitles
- Loyalty program and transaction history per member
- BCNF normalization with justification
- Sample data population for demonstration
- Oracle-compatible SQL implementation and query testing

## Tools Used

- Oracle SQL Developer
- Draw.io for ER modeling
- Microsoft Word and PDF for documentation
- Manual SQL scripting for schema, population, and queries
